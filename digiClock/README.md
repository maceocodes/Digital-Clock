# Digital Alarm Clock

This is a small project I took on to hopefully strengthen my understanding of basic JavaScript.

The project should present a view that shows the current time, a "Set Time" and a "Clear Time" button.

The "Set Time" button will present drop down menus for the hour, minute, and period (am/pm) selections.  

Clicking the "Save" button will store the time selected as the set time (Clicking the "Cancel" button will give the option to clear your selection and return to the clock view).  That time will be displayed under the date upon returning to the clock view.  An audio file will be played and alert is displayed when the time selected matches the current time.  

The "Clear Time" button clears your selected time.
